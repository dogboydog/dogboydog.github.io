# FunKey Speedrun Leaderboards


This page lists speedruns that have been completed using the [FunKey S](/wiki/FunKey_S.md "FunKey S"). As long as the criteria listed below have been followed, any runner can add their own FunKey S speedruns to this page.

## Contents

* [1 Qualification criteria](#qualification-criteria)
* [2 Games](#games)
  - [2.1 Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team](#pokemon-mystery-dungeon-red-rescue-team)
    + [2.1.1 Any% (No Quicksaving or Wondermail)](#any-no-quicksaving-or-wondermail)

## Qualification criteria 

All speedruns present on this page must:

* Be played on the FunKey S.
* Adhere to the requirements at least one of the categories listed for that game on the speedrun.com website.
* Have a publicly-accessible video recording. It must be clear from the recording that the game is being played in real-time, rather than a video playback of a pre-existing speedrun. Suggested methods of accomplishing this are showing the game being loaded from the RetroFE menu prior to the start of the speedrun and/or showing the FunKey S controls being used at some point during the run. The device's screen must also be visible on-screen at all times.

If a speedrun meets all of the criteria listed above, it may be listed on this page. The speedrunner may do this themselves or ask a wiki editor to do so for them. Elements such as commentary, on-screen timers, and aspect ratio are up to the preference of each runner. For the sake of record preservation, even if a runner beats a previous run of theirs in the same category, the original run(s) should remain listed on that category's leaderboard. Conversely, a runner should only post a run if it is or was at some point their personal best in the specified category.

## Games 

This section lists games that have at least one recorded speedrun completed using the FunKey S. Each game has subsections that denote which category each speedrun qualifies under.
