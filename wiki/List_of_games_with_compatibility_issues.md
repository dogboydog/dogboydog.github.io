# List of games with compatibility issues

From The FunKey Wiki



This article lists games that have compatibility issues with the default FunKey S emulators. As the compatibility of such games can range from fully-compatible to fully-incompatible, compatibility issues have been divided into four main categories based on severity: [fully-compatible](#fully-compatible-games), [fully-playable](#fully-playable-games), [partially-compatible](#partially-compatible-games), and [incompatible](#incompatible-games). These categories list games that are glitch-free if configured correctly, slightly-glitched, heavily-glitched, and incompatible, respectively. While games in the first two sections should generally be played via the default emulators and those in the last two should generally be played via [third-party emulators](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications"), any game listed in this article not marked in bold should have improved compatibility in at least one of the higher CPU usage third-party emulators. Bold-formatted games that are also italicized require additional testing to see if a change of settings and/or emulators fixes their compatibility issue. The [fifth section](#playstation-games-that-have-compatibility-issues-with-the-default-bios) of this article lists PlayStation games that have compatibility issues if the official PlayStation BIOS file is not added to the FunKey S [as instructed here](https://doc.funkey-project.com/user_manual/tutorials/software/gba_bios/). Conversely, games with improved compatibility via the use of the default BIOS rather than the official PlayStation one have their listings highlighted in grey. While FunKey S Game Boy Advance emulation has a default compatibility rate of approximately 91 percent when games from the latter two categories are combined and subtracted (compared to [96 to 100 percent](/wiki/FunKey_Wiki_Knowledge_Center#Are_there_any_games_that_aren%27t_emulated_properly_on_the_FunKey_S? "FunKey Wiki Knowledge Center") for the other default emulators), nearly all games from the remaining nine percent can be played at full or near-full speed via the use one of the aforementioned third-party emulators. As this article does not seek to list accurately emulated games as some compatibility lists do, if you cannot find a game by searching for it via your browser's search tool, it is most likely emulated without issue on the FunKey S. If a new compatibility issue is found, however, please inform the [the wiki admin](/wiki/User_talk:CoolieCoolster "User talk:CoolieCoolster") so that this article may be amended. While this article exists primarily to document the capabilities of the FunKey S [default emulators](https://github.com/FunKey-Project), as many of these emulators are multi-platform and different emulators can share compatibility issues, many of the glitches documented here occur on other devices as well.

## Fully-compatible games [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Fully-compatible games") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Fully-compatible games")]

This section lists games that are fully-compatible on the FunKey S, in most cases having no emulator-caused glitching if the instructions listed in each subsection are followed.

### Games with region-specific glitches [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Games with region-specific glitches") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Games with region-specific glitches")]

As the following table lists games that have a region-specific glitches, users should use the recommended regional variant of that game to avoid the occurrence of the listed glitch(es). While games with glitching across all regional variants are highlighted in yellow, the lesser glitching of the recommended variant is why they remain listed here. In cases where a game has varying names across regions, the name of the recommended version has been underlined. In the case of the listed Game Boy Advance _Final Fantasy_ games, while the application of various ROM hacks may override the glitches found in their North American regional variants, such hacks also have the potential of introducing new incompatibilities.

### Games that require patching [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Games that require patching") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Games that require patching")]

The following table lists games that must be patched to be fully-playable on the FunKey S. After downloading the patch file that matches the regional variant of your game backup (if available), download and extract the [Lunar IPS](/wiki/files/Lunar_IPS.zip) patching program if you are using Windows, or another IPS-capable patching program if otherwise. To use Lunar IPS, begin by launching the application and selecting _Apply IPS Patch_. After selecting your matching IPS and ROM files, the application will apply the modifications to the ROM file and finish with a _The file was successfully patched!_ message. The game can then be put into the folder of its respective console on the FunKey S.

In _Koro Koro Puzzle - Happy Panechu!_, _WarioWare: Twisted!_, and _Yoshi Topsy-Turvy_, the directional buttons are used to indicate tilting directions, with the B button used to accelerate the tilting in the case of _WarioWare: Twisted!_. For the first Boktai game, the _LEFT+A+R_ and _RIGHT+A+R_ button combinations are used to decrease and increase the level of sunlight, respectively. For the other two Boktai games, the _LEFT+SELECT_ and _RIGHT+SELECT_ combinations are used instead. As SELECT is also FN, however, _KEY_ files available for download [below](#games-that-require-adapted-controls) are needed to make the latter two Boktai games compatible with the FunKey S.

### Games that require an SBI file [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Games that require an SBI file") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Games that require an SBI file")]

The [PAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL_region "w:PAL region") regional variants of the following PlayStation games require the use of an _SBI_ file to function properly (any [NTSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC "w:NTSC") regional variants of these games, however, do not need the additional file). To configure one of these files for a specific game, download and unzip the linked-to file for your regional variant of that game and place it in the _PS1_ folder of the FunKey S alongside the respective ROM file(s) of that game. Ensure that each game's _SBI_ file has the same file name as that game's ROM file(s) (example.sbi for example.bin and example.cue). As these games require their respective _SBI_ files no matter which emulator is used, they are marked in bold to indicate the need for that file.

### Games that require adapted controls [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Games that require adapted controls") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Games that require adapted controls")]

Since the SELECT and FN inputs share one button, it is possible for gameplay functionality tied to button combinations that include SELECT and directional or action buttons to be impaired by the system's shortcuts. To solve this problem, _KEY_ files can be used to adjust the device's button mapping on a per-game or per-console basis, moving or removing interfering shortcuts where necessary. While most games can retain access to all shortcuts via shortcut or button relocation, due to their higher than average number of button combinations, _Treasures of the Deep_, _Wing Commander_, and _Wing Commander: The Secret Missions_ required the removal of several system shortcuts to ensure game compatibility. In some cases, multiple _KEY_ files are available to allow users to choose their preferred remapping. To install the _KEY_ file of one of the games listed below, begin by downloading and extracting its respective file. After ensuring that the _KEY_ and ROM file names match, place the _KEY_ file in the same folder as that game on the FunKey S. As this section only lists games that require _KEY_ file input remapping for full compatibility, consult the wiki's list of [pre-configured KEY files](/wiki/List_of_pre-configured_KEY_files "List of pre-configured KEY files") for games with optional button combinations that require the use of a _KEY_ file to access.

While _KEY_ files are the primary method of button remapping, Game Boy and Game Boy Color games can have their inputs alternatively remapped via the use of their emulator's configuration file. Should you wish to remap your device's buttons via this method, a pre-configured configuration file that adds additional mappings of SELECT (without FN tied to it) and START to the device's shoulder buttons can be downloaded [here](/wiki/files/Final_Fantasy_VIII_Alternate_KEY_File.zip) that returns the mapping of the shoulder and trigger inputs to normal can subsequently be used.

### Games with other glitches [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Games with other glitches") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Games with other glitches")]

The following games have emulation issues by default that do not fit into any of the categories above. As games with similar issues have combined into subsections of this subsection, be sure to also read the subsection descriptions of games of interest to you ensure the full compatibility of those games.

#### Games that require a pre-existing save file [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Games that require a pre-existing save file") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Games that require a pre-existing save file")]

This subsection lists Game Boy Advance games that require the presence of a pre-prepared _SAV_ format save file to allow the user to bypass the opening sequences, ensuring full-playability. While such a save file can be created for any of the listed games by simply loading each game's ROM file in a computer Game Boy Advance emulator (or the natively-running [third-party mGBA emulator](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications")) and generating save data as soon as possible, users who don't mind having a default name associated with their save data can download one of the pre-prepared _SAV_ files linked-to below instead. Once this file is generated or downloaded, it should be placed in the _GBA_ folder of the FunKey S, replacing any existing _SAV_ file for the respective game. From then on, if selecting _New Game_ rather than _Resume Game_, users should be sure to always load their pre-existing save file rather than creating a new one to prevent a crash from occurring.

#### Games that require a default BIOS [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Games that require a default BIOS") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Games that require a default BIOS")]

This subsection lists PlayStation games that are not emulated correctly via the use of the [official PlayStation BIOS](https://doc.funkey-project.com/user_manual/tutorials/software/gba_bios/), and thus must be emulated without it. To play one of the games listed below, remove the _SCPH1001.BIN_ file from the _/mnt/PS1/bios_ location of the FunKey S file system and place it anywhere else in the device's file system. Once you are done playing that game, return the BIOS file to its intended location to avoid potential emulation issues with other games. This process can be accomplished either by connecting the FunKey S to a computer or by using the device's _Commander_ file management application. In the case of _T'ai Fu: Wrath of the Tiger_, while the game is still fully-compatible with the official BIOS, to make loading into the game take several seconds rather than several minutes, it is recommended that the default BIOS be used with the game to stop this glitch from occurring.

#### Games that require a configuration file [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Games that require a configuration file") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Games that require a configuration file")]

The PAL versions of the following NES games have severe graphical glitches due to being emulated in NTSC mode by default. To fix this issue, download and extract the associated game's _CFG_ file from its _ZIP_ archive, and placed it in the _/mnt/FunKey/.fceux/cfg_ location of the FunKey S file system. If you don't see the _.fceux_ folder, your computer's Unix-based operating system is hiding hidden folders. To enable the viewing of such folders on MacOS, use the _Shift+Cmd+Period_ key combination. To do so on ChromeOS, click the three-dot icon at the top-right of the _Files_ application and select the _Show hidden folders_ option. Once this is done, ensure that the names of the game's _CFG_ and ROM files match and that any pre-existing configuration files for the game are deleted. The game will subsequently be emulated in PAL mode, enabling PAL timings and full-compatibility. Should you prefer to skip this process by simply using a game's NTSC version instead, games with that option available have been marked below.

This subsection lists games that freeze during their opening video sequences. To fix this, simply close and reopen the FunKey S when this occurs and the videos should continue normally. In the case of _Vampire Hunter D_, simply press the Start button three times and the game will continue on normally.

This subsection lists games that have one or more glitches that occur when opposing directional buttons are pressed, something that cannot normally be done on original hardware. While none of these glitches affect gameplay permanently, as save states and/or restarts usually resolve them, they remain notable nonetheless.

This subsection lists games whose compatibility varies between game releases and/or revisions. To verify that your backup of one of the following games is compatible with the FunKey S, ensure that the CRC32 checksum value of its ROM file matches one of those listed below. To check the CRC32 checksum value of your game backup's ROM file, use [this](http://emn178.github.io/online-tools/crc32_checksum.html) utility.

## Fully-playable games [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Fully-playable games") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Fully-playable games")]

This section lists games that are fully-playable on the FunKey S, but have a glitch that affects gameplay in some way. Sometimes these glitches are minor, such as transparency flickering or graphical glitches during instances of menu changing, while other glitches are more noticeable, such as slowdown or avoidable non-sporadic crashing. Unlike games listed in the [incompatible](#incompatible-games) or [partially-compatible](#partially-compatible-games) sections, however, games listed here should be fully-playable from beginning to end without unavoidable crashing, severe graphical glitches, or severe slowdown. If you find that any list in this article is missing a game or that one of the games listed works as intended, feel free to edit that list yourself or inform [the wiki admin](/wiki/User_talk:CoolieCoolster "User talk:CoolieCoolster")!

### Games with transparency glitches [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Games with transparency glitches") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Games with transparency glitches")]

In some games, transparency effects are mimicked by rapidly enabling and disabling a texture overlaying a background, making an object appear transparent if done rapidly enough. Emulation errors and differences in timing can at times diminish the effectiveness of this trick, rendering the flicking more visible than intended, creating a mildly unpleasant effect. Below is a list of games where such a glitch has been found.

### Games with menu-change graphical glitches [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Games with menu-change graphical glitches") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Games with menu-change graphical glitches")]

The following Game Boy Advance games have been found to have graphical glitching occur during infrequent instances of menu changes. As these glitches only occur during menu changes (and often only once or twice when a game is started for the first time), this type of glitch usually does not affect core gameplay. GBA games included in the multi-pak releases highlighted in orange below should be played separately to reduce the likelihood of graphical glitches occurring.

### Games emulated at an incorrect speed [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Games emulated at an incorrect speed") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Games emulated at an incorrect speed")]

Games listed below have light to moderate speedup or slowdown, though not sufficiently severe to render them entirely unplayable. Most PlayStation games listed below have slowdown due to being some of the most demanding games for that system, while Master System games listed below are sped up by twenty percent due to incorrectly being emulated at a 60 FPS framerate.

### Games with avoidable non-sporadic crashing [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Games with avoidable non-sporadic crashing") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Games with avoidable non-sporadic crashing")]

The following games have been found to crash non-sporadically during gameplay. As games that crash this way unavoidably are listed [further down the page](#games-with-unavoidable-non-sporadic-crashing), most games listed below have accompanying instructions detailing how to prevent the respective game from crashing. The one exception to this is _Snatcher_ for the Sega CD, which has at least three points during gameplay where the game temporary freezes for several minutes, with background animation and, in some cases, music continuing until text appears and gameplay can continue. While none of these instances of crashing prevent main game completion and most not be discovered by chance very often, should you wish to improve the emulation accuracy of the GBA games on the list, you can use one of the more accurate, though potentially slower, [third-party GBA emulators](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications").

## Partially-compatible games [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Partially-compatible games") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Partially-compatible games")]

Games listed below are believed to be playable to completion on the FunKey S, but have severe emulation glitches that hamper gameplay. Because of this, it is recommended that, where available, [third-party](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications") emulators be used to play these games on the FunKey S. This section currently lists **22** licensed games confirmed to be partially-compatible.

### Games with severe graphical glitches [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Games with severe graphical glitches") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Games with severe graphical glitches")]

The following games have severe graphical glitches that are constantly noticeable. While all games listed here are believed to still be fully-playable, in the case of Game Boy Advance games it is recommended that one of the more demanding, yet more accurate, [third-party emulators](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications") be used instead. Note that while the Game Boy Advance game _Risk / Battleship / Clue_ is listed here, only the _Battleship_ portion of it is impacted by a severe graphical glitch.

As the Sega Master System version of _Micro Machines_ crashes in the system's default emulator, to avoid its complete incompatibility it must be converted to the Game Gear format. To do this, simply change the file extension of the game's ROM file from _SMS_ to _GG_ and place that file in the _Game Gear_, rather than _Sega Master System_, folder of the FunKey S. While the game will be zoomed in and graphically glitched due to the differences of the Game Gear hardware, the game itself remains entirely playable. Despite this, the use of a third-party emulator to emulate _Micro Machines_ and the twelve incompatible Sega Master System games that remain unplayable when converted this way is still recommended.

### Games with sporadic crashing [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Games with sporadic crashing") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: Games with sporadic crashing")]

The following games have been found to crash sporadically during gameplay. _Chrono Cross_ has been found to randomly get stuck on a black screen after closing the in-game menu. Videos illustrating the issue can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CSBdXC8Hn8) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNyc_s-3C5w); the regular updating of save states and/or in-game saves to restore the game to is the recommended counter-measure. In addition to freezing sporadically when cutscenes are triggered, _Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths & Legends_ also freezes if audio from the game's logbook is played. _Thrasher Presents Skate and Destroy_ has been found to sporadically crash infrequently during gameplay, though this issue has so far not been found in the [PAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PAL_region "w:PAL region") variants of the game. As there is no set point at which the GBA games on the list crash, they are partially compatible, though it is recommended that one of the [alternate](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications"), albeit potentially slower, emulators be used with these games instead to entirely avoid the risk of crashing. If you decide to play these games in the default gpSP emulator, be sure to create regular save states as a means of reloading in case a crash does occur.

### Games with unavoidable non-sporadic crashing [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Games with unavoidable non-sporadic crashing") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Games with unavoidable non-sporadic crashing")]

The following games have been found to crash non-sporadically during gameplay. As games that crash this way avoidably are listed [further up the page](#games-with-unavoidable-non-sporadic-crashing), all games listed below cannot be played without an unavoidable crash occurring at some point during gameplay. The solutions to these instances of crashing vary; as _Air Hockey_ only crashes when a match ends, only a restart is required. As _The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap_ and _Final Fantasy VIII_ only crash at a certain point, one option would be to save, continue in a computer GBA emulator (or the natively-running [third-party mGBA emulator](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications")) to bypass the crash point, and subsequently continue gameplay on the FunKey S. For a more consistent gameplay experience, however, the use of [third-party emulators](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications") for these games is recommended.

### Games suspected of crashing [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Games suspected of crashing") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Games suspected of crashing")]

While the following games initially appear to be emulated accurately, they have been reported to eventually crash in emulators similar to those of the FunKey S. Based on the results of on-device compatibility testing, they will either be moved to the subsection above if the reported crash occurs, or removed if it does not. Glitches that have been reported to cause their respective games to crash to one of the device's application launchers are marked in bold.

### Games with other issues [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Games with other issues") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Games with other issues")]

Even when not listed as fully-incompatible [below](#games-that-require-improved-emulation), [GBA video paks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_Video "w:Game Boy Advance Video") often have severe emulation issues, such as audio glitching and crashing, that render them unpleasant to use in the default Game Boy Advance emulator. While a [third-party](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications") emulator could be used to solve many of these glitches, it is recommended that the natively-running MPlayer application be [downloaded](/wiki/files/MPlayer-V2.opk) instead for video playback on the FunKey S.

## Incompatible games [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Incompatible games") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: Incompatible games")]

Games listed below either do not run at all on the FunKey S or cannot be played beyond a certain point due to either unemulated hardware or inaccurate emulation. This section currently lists **305** licensed games confirmed to be fully-incompatible. If you find that a game functions on the FunKey S but has a glitch of some sort, consult one of the [lists above](#fully-playable-games) to see if that game is listed.

### Games that require disk swapping [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Games that require disk swapping") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Games that require disk swapping")]

As neither the default Famicom Disk System nor PlayStation emulators currently have user-accessible disk swapping capabilities, games that require such functionality are currently not fully-compatible. Aside from _Parasite Eve II_, all PlayStation games listed below can still be played on the FunKey S via a [third-party](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications") version of the default PlayStation emulator with implemented disk-swapping support. As the contents of _Metal Gear Solid_ and _Command & Conquer: Red Alert_ are contained in their equally incompatible _Metal Gear Solid: Integral_ and _Command & Conquer Red Alert: Retaliation_ re-releases, to avoid repetition, the initial releases are not listed in the table below. While _Final Fantasy Anthology_, _Final Fantasy Chronicles_, and _Gran Turismo 2_ are also multi-disk releases, as their disks can be played independently of each other, they remain fully-compatible. While the Family Computer Disk System version of _Zelda II: The Adventure of Link_ requires the user to swap the disk for game completion, as the game is available for the Nintendo Entertainment System as a cartridge as well, it remains fully-compatible. Excluding games for the yet-to-be fully-supported Famicom Disk System, at least **60** games are currently incompatible due to unimplemented disk-swapping capabilities.

### Games that require unemulated hardware [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Games that require unemulated hardware") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: Games that require unemulated hardware")]

The following table lists games that cannot be played on the FunKey S due to the requirement of hardware that the FunKey S does not currently emulate. While some compatible games support unemulated hardware such as IR sensors, barcode scanners, the e-Reader, and the Game Boy Printer, among others, only games that require such add-on hardware for core functionality are listed here as incompatible. At least **32** games are currently incompatible due to unemulated add-on hardware.

### Games that require improved emulation [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&veaction=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Games that require improved emulation") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues&action=edit&section=29 "Edit section: Games that require improved emulation")]

The table below lists **213** licensed games that are incompatible with the FunKey S due to inaccuracies in the official emulation of the following systems:
SMS         **12** PS1         **35** GB           **5** GBC          **2** GG          **10** WS/WSC      **5** SNES         **21** GBA        **123**

Unless otherwise noted in the last column of the table, however, the following [third-party emulators](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications") can be used as fast alternatives to accurately emulate games that are otherwise incompatible due to inaccurate emulation:

| Master System / Game Gear |
| Game Boy / Game Boy Color |
| Super Nintendo Entertainment System |
| PlayStation |
| WonderSwan / WonderSwan Color |
| Game Boy Advance |

| SMS Plus GX |
| Gambatte |
| Snes9x 2010 |
| PCSX ReARMed Ultimate |
| SwanEmu |
| gpSP _(SDL Retro)_ |

In addition to the incompatibilities numerated above, at least **19** multi-pak, **8** [GBA Video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_Video "w:Game Boy Advance Video"), **16** homebrew, and **1** event-only games have also been found to be incompatible due to faulty emulation. While for a variety of reasons these games are not included in the main numerical counts, they are still listed below for the sake of completeness. To differentiate them, they are have been both highlighted as a means of recognizing them and marked on in the leftmost column as a means of sorting them. A set of icons above the table serves as a legend for the associated colors and markings. As the multi-pak incompatibilities listed below are due to incompatible methods of 'multi-packing', games within these multi-paks are usually compatible if played separately. If you find that the list is missing a game or that one of the games listed works as intended, feel free to edit the list yourself or inform [the wiki admin](/wiki/User_talk:CoolieCoolster "User talk:CoolieCoolster")!
