This article lists commercial software available for systems emulated by the FunKey S. To maintain the quality and consistency of these lists, a set of [inclusion criteria](/wiki/Available_third-party_software#Inclusion_criteria "Available third-party software") has been defined for all software listed on The FunKey Wiki. For completeness sake, the prices of games and game collections are listed, though the final price paid may differ from the one listed here due to sales, pricing changes, taxes, shipping costs, and/or other factors.

## List contents [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&veaction=edit&section=1 "Edit section: List contents") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: List contents")]

This article currently documents **251** digitally-available commercial games, of which 176 are DRM-free while 75 are not, 161 are part of collections while 90 are not, and 174 are licensed while 77 are not. Such games are for the following systems:

| NES **96** |
| Master System **1** |
| Turbografx-16 **2** |
| Genesis **80** |
| Game Boy **15** |

| SNES **29** |
| PlayStation **9** |
| Game Boy Color **4** |
| NGPC **11** |
| GBA **7** |

Not included in the counts above are the **103** games that are currently only purchasable in a physical format, making their use on the FunKey S significantly more difficult. Should one of these games eventually also become available in a digital format, it will be moved to the list above. Such games are for the following systems:

| NES **57** |
| Turbografx-16 **3** |
| Genesis **21** |

| SNES **20** |
| Game Boy Color **1** |
| GBA **1** |

If a console officially emulatable by the FunKey S is not listed above, no commercially available games were found for it. As **115** ROMs listed in this article are for Arcade platforms, they will only included in the counts above once Arcade emulation is officially added to [FunKey-OS](/wiki/FunKey-OS "FunKey-OS"). Emulatable games that are commercially available but have entirely inaccessible ROMs are not included in these counts and are listed in the _ [ROMs not accessible](#roms-not-accessible)_ section of this article. If a method for extracting the ROMs of any of these games is found, they will be moved to another list in this article and included in the game counts. If you believe that a game is missing from any list on this page, feel free to add it yourself or inform a wiki editor.

## ROMs directly accessible [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&veaction=edit&section=2 "Edit section: ROMs directly accessible") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: ROMs directly accessible")]

This section lists commercial games that have their ROM files directly available to the user upon purchase. Games that also have physical versions currently being sold are marked with a **¹** symbol. As _NEScape!_ is incompatible with the default NES emulator of the FunKey S, it requires the use of the [third-party](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications") _FCEUmm_ emulator.

### Individual releases [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&veaction=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Individual releases") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Individual releases")]

This section lists 87 individually released DRM-free games.

## ROMs accessible with third-party software [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&veaction=edit&section=18 "Edit section: ROMs accessible with third-party software") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: ROMs accessible with third-party software")]

This section lists commercial emulatable games that do not have their ROM files directly available to the user upon purchase but can still be extracted through the use of third-party software. Links to guides for extracting ROMs from the individually released games and game collections are listed for each of the releases. If a user finds that one of the guides no longer functions and there is no alternative guide or method for extracting the listed games, the game associated with that guide will be moved to the [ROMs not accessible](#roms-not-accessible) section of this article until an alternative extraction guide can be found.

### Individual releases [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&veaction=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Individual releases") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Individual releases")]

The following re-releases of licensed PlayStation games by _Console Classics_ each include a PlayStation emulator and a file called _GameData.dat_ containing an encrypted _BIN_ file of the corresponding game. To decrypt this file for use on the FunKey S, download and extract [this](https://static.miraheze.org/funkeywiki/9/92/Xor.zip) tool to its own folder and add the _GameData.dat_ file to that folder.

If using Windows, open and use the Command Prompt application to navigate to the folder containing the aforementioned files. Lastly, run the _**xor.exe GameData.dat <u>BINFileName</u>.bin 0x42**_ command to extract the _BIN_ file, with _**<u>BINFileName</u>**_ replaced with the contents of the _BIN File Name_ column of the table below for that game.

If using Linux, open the Command Terminal application in the specified folder and run the _**wine xor.exe GameData.dat <u>BINFileName</u>.bin 0x42**_ command, with _**<u>BINFileName</u>**_ replaced with the contents of the _BIN File Name_ column of the table below for that game.

Finally, to allow PCSX-ReARMed to locate the audio data present within the _BIN_ file, the copyright-free _CUE_ file of the specified game should be downloaded from the table below and put into the _PS1_ folder of the FunKey S along with the _BIN_ file. While _Console Classics_ has other PlayStation releases on Steam that can also be decrypted via this method, they will remain listed in the [ROMs not accessible](#roms-not-accessible) section of this article instead until compatible _CUE_ files can be generated for them.

#### Castlevania Advance Collection [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&veaction=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Castlevania Advance Collection") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: Castlevania Advance Collection")]

Published by Konami, the _Castlevania Advance Collection_ includes **4** emulatable games, of which three are for the _Game Boy Advance_ and one is for the _SNES_. It can be purchased on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1552550/Castlevania_Advance_Collection/) for **$19.99**. As the collection's game ROM files are not accessible by default, they must be extracted before they can be put onto the FunKey S. To do this, begin by downloading the [.NET framework](http://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and the [Windows](https://static.miraheze.org/funkeywiki/4/48/MArchiveBatchTool_%28Windows%29.zip) or [Linux](https://static.miraheze.org/funkeywiki/a/ac/MArchiveBatchTool_%28Linux%29.zip) version of the MArchiveBtchTool utility. Next, extract the folder from the archived utility and place the collection's _alldata.bin_ and _alldata.psb.m_ files into it. If using Windows, navigate to the folder using the Command Prompt application and enter the command <u>_MArchiveBatchTool.exe fullunpack --keep alldata.psb.m zlib 25G/xpvTbsb+6 64_</u>. If using Linux, open the Shell application in the folder and enter the command <u>_./MArchiveBatchTool fullunpack --keep alldata.psb.m zlib 25G/xpvTbsb+6 64_</u>. Lastly, locate the extracted ROM files in the _\alldata.psb.m_extracted\system\roms_ location of your computer's file system and copy the ones you wish to use onto your FunKey S.

Note that due to how the sound for the GBA games in the collection was re-implemented, the ROM files of those games do not have sound when extracted. To fix this issue, patches have been created to allow users who purchased the _Castlevania Advance Collection_ to reenable the audio for the collection's extracted Game Boy Advance games. Available for download [here](https://static.miraheze.org/funkeywiki/2/23/Castlevania_Advance_Collection_Audio_Restoration_Patches.zip), the set of patches includes patches for the European, Japanese, and North American versions of all three affected games. After choosing which patches to use, you can apply them to your purchased games via the the use of the _Floating IPS_ application for [Windows](https://static.miraheze.org/funkeywiki/9/93/Floating_IPS_%28Windows%29.zip) or [Linux](https://static.miraheze.org/funkeywiki/4/4b/Floating_IPS_%28Linux%29.zip). To use Floating IPS, begin by launching the application and selecting _Apply Patch_. After selecting your matching IPS and ROM files, the application will apply the modifications to the ROM file and finish with a _The file was successfully patched!_ message. The game can then be put into the _Game Boy Advance_ folder of the FunKey S.

## ROMs accessible with third-party hardware [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&veaction=edit&section=36 "Edit section: ROMs accessible with third-party hardware") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&action=edit&section=36 "Edit section: ROMs accessible with third-party hardware")]

This section lists commercial emulatable games that are currently only being sold physically. Games in this section require the use of a [game backup device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_backup_device "w:Game backup device") to extract the ROMs of those games from their cartridges or discs for use on the FunKey S. An example of one such device is the [Retrode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrode "w:Retrode"), which can backup SNES and Sega Genesis games out of the box. For the systems of games listed below, the Retrode also has add-on cartridges available to backup TurboGrafx-16, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games. Since the Retrode is no longer available for sale from its manufacturer, however, it would have to be purchased from a third-party seller. Another option that includes support for NES games is the [INLretro](http://www.infiniteneslives.com/inlretro.php), however, it does not automatically put ROM headers on ROM files, and thus is not as simple to use as the Retrode.

Since the primary purpose of the game lists on this wiki is to provide a means for FunKey S users to find digital copies of games to put onto their devices, the following lists do not include all commercially available physically released games for FunKey S emulatable systems, only games that are not available from their publishers digitally. While this means that digitally released games with physical releases are not listed on the following tables, such games are marked with a **¹** symbol on the lists of digital [freeware](/wiki/List_of_emulatable_games_(freeware) "List of emulatable games (freeware)") and [commercial](#roms-directly-accessible) games. Also not included are physically released games only available for a limited time or in limited quantities. Additionally, if a game is no longer being sold, it will be removed from its list.

Games that are available on another emulatable platform digitally are marked with a **²** symbol, though remain on the following list as the versions listed here are not available digitally. As each game is listed at its lowest commercially available price, the inclusion of a game box, dust sleeve, and/or manual often costs an additional ten to twenty dollars.

### Individual releases [[edit](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&veaction=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Individual releases") | [edit source](/w/index.php?title=List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial)&action=edit&section=37 "Edit section: Individual releases")]

This section lists 78 individually released games only available in a physical format.
