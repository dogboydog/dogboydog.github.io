# List of emulatable games (commercial)


This article lists commercial software available for systems emulated by the FunKey S. To maintain the quality and consistency of these lists, a set of [inclusion criteria](/wiki/Available_third-party_software#Inclusion_criteria "Available third-party software") has been defined for all software listed on The FunKey Wiki. For completeness sake, the prices of games and game collections are listed, though the final price paid may differ from the one listed here due to sales, pricing changes, taxes, shipping costs, and/or other factors.

## List contents 

This article currently lists **398** commercially available emulatable games, of which **294** are available digitally and **104** are only available in a physical format. Of the digitally available games, 191 are DRM-free while 103 are not, and 229 are part of collections while 65 are not. Of the games that are only available physically, 32 are part of collections while 78 are not. Emulatable games that are commercially available but have entirely inaccessible ROMs are not included in these counts and are listed in the _ [ROMs not accessible](#roms-not-accessible)_ section of this article. If a method for extracting the ROMs of any of these games is found, they will be moved to another list in this article and included in the game counts.

The digitally available games are divided into the following categories:

Consoles that the FunKey S can emulate but are not listed here have no commercially available games that were found for them. If there is a game missing from these lists, feel free to add it yourself or inform a wiki editor.

## ROMs directly accessible

## ROMs accessible with third-party software 

This section lists commercial emulatable games that do not have their ROM files directly available to the user upon purchase but can still be extracted through the use of third-party software. Links to guides for extracting ROMs from the individually released games and game collections are listed for each of the releases. If a user finds that one of the guides no longer functions and there is no alternative guide or method for extracting the listed games, they will be moved to the [ROMs not accessible](#roms-not-accessible) section.

### Individual releases 

The only individual release with an encrypted ROM accessible via third-party tools is N2O: Nitrous Oxide for the PS1. As with other PS1 games, the ROM for N2O is a set of two files: a BIN file and a CUE file. While the BIN file is present in the Steam directory, it is encrypted, and there is no CUE file. However, [this guide](https://steamcommunity.com/app/364840/discussions/0/520519112496664465/) can be used to decrypt the BIN file and create the CUE file. While the publisher's other PS1 releases on Steam are encrypted in the same way, as there are no guides available online to extract the ROM files for those games, they have been listed in the [ROMs not accessible](#roms-not-accessible) section of this article.

| Name of Game | Link | Genre | Price | System | Release Type | Game Art |
| N2O: Nitrous Oxide | [Link](https://store.steampowered.com/app/364840/N2O_Nitrous_Oxide/) | [Arcade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game "w:Arcade game") | $4.99 | PS1 | Licensed |  |

## ROMs accessible with third-party hardware 

This section lists commercial emulatable games that are currently only being sold physically. Games in this section require the use of a [game backup device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_backup_device "w:Game backup device") to extract the ROMs of those games from their cartridges or discs for use on the FunKey S. An example of one such device is the [Retrode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrode "w:Retrode"), which can backup SNES and Sega Genesis games out of the box. For the systems of games listed below, the Retrode also has add-on cartridges available to backup TurboGrafx-16, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games. Since the Retrode is no longer available for sale from its manufacturer, however, it would have to be purchased from a third-party seller. Another option that includes support for NES games is the [INLretro](http://www.infiniteneslives.com/inlretro.php), however, it does not automatically put ROM headers on ROM files, and thus is not as simple to use as the Retrode.

Since the primary purpose of the game lists on this wiki is to provide a means for FunKey S users to find digital copies of games to put onto their devices, the following lists do not include all commercially available physically released games for FunKey S emulatable systems, only games that are not available from their publishers digitally. While this means that digitally released games with physical releases are not listed on the following tables, such games are marked with a **¹** symbol on the lists of digital [freeware](/wiki/List_of_emulatable_games_(freeware).md "List of emulatable games (freeware)") and [commercial](#roms-directly-accessible) games. Also not included are physically released games only available for a limited time or in limited quantities. Additionally, if a game is no longer being sold, it will be removed from its list.

Games that are available on another emulatable platform digitally are marked with a **²** symbol, though remain on the following list as the versions listed here are not available digitally. Games are listed at their lowest commercially available price, and thus the price for many of the following games only includes a cartridge with the corresponding game on it, though for many there are additional purchase options that include a box, dust sleeve, and/or manual for an additional $10-$20.
