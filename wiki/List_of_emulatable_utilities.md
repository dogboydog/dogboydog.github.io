# List of emulatable utilities


This article lists utility programs that can be emulated on the FunKey S. Utilities are currently divided into five categories: Creative, Emulation, Media, Text, and Other. Creative utilities include drawing programs and music-making programs; emulation utilities allow the user to emulate a system not natively emulated on the FunKey S using a system that is; media utilities include photo viewers, music players, and video players; text utilities include text display software, eBook readers, and text editors; and other includes any utilities that cannot be categorized using one of the primary categories. There are currently **31** utilities listed, comprising 4 Calculation utilities, 7 Creative utilities, 4 Emulation utilities, 7 Media utilities, 5 Text utilities, and 3 Other utilities. There are also **19** public domain eBooks listed in either (or both) Game Boy or Game Boy Advance ROM format. As the Game Boy Advance utilities highlighted in yellow are not emulated accurately in the default FunKey S Game Boy Advance emulator, they should be used with a [third-party emulator](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications") instead.

## Calculation

This section lists emulatable calculation utilities. Note that while _TI83 Emu_ is technically an emulated implementation of the TI-83, thus requiring that calculator's BIOS file to run, it is listed here rather than in the [emulator section](#emulation) due to its lack of TI-83 program support.

## Emulation

This section lists emulators emulatable by the Game Boy or Game Boy Advance that are not already emulated well, either officially or via a [third-party emulator](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications"), by the FunKey S. This currently includes the Atari 2600, ColecoVision, MSX, and SG-1000, among others.

| GB-8 | Chip-8 | GB | Out of all the Game Boy emulators available for the FunKey S, as GB-8 is fully-incompatible with gnuboy (the default Game Boy emulator) and Gearboy, and only partially-compatible with mGBA, it should be emulated on the FunKey S using [Gambatte](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications"). Additionally, while users are able to compile their own version of GB-8 via the source files linked-to on the right, as this process is quite complicated, the editors of The FunKey Wiki have hand-picked and compiled the most functional of the available CHIP-8 games for the convenience of users. Note that as the emulator requires the use of a _Select + Start + A + B_ button combination, a _KEY_ file that frees up the _FN+A_ and _FN+B_ button combinations has been bundled with the pre-configured emulator ROM file. | [Link](https://github.com/Hacktix/GB-8) | [Download](/wiki/files/GB-8.zip) |
| PocketBeeb | BBC Micro | GBA | Emulates _SSD_ format BBC Micro disc image files and _UEF_ format save states..md "Fat Pixel" and "Teletext" emulation is imperfect, several complex games such as _Elite_ are incompatible, and tape emulation is not implemented. | [Link](https://pdroms.de/files/nintendo-gameboyadvance-gba/pocket-beeb-v1-01) | [Download](/wiki/files/PocketBeeb.zip) |

## Media

This section lists emulatable utilities with media capabilities, including photo viewers and music players. While a video player for the Game Boy Advance [does exist](http://www.gameboy-advance.net/video/), due to its significant limitations, the use of the natively-running [MPlayer video player](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Applications "List of third-party OPK applications") is recommended instead.
