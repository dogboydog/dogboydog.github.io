<u>FAQ</u>

### What is the purpose of this wiki?

The purpose of this wiki is to serve as a database of information related to the FunKey S. This includes information about the FunKey S hardware, firmware, compatible homebrew games, and third-party software released for the device. As the FunKey Wiki is run by the community independently of the FunKey Team, there may at times be erroneous or inconsistent information listed. If there is a piece of information that you are unsure or have further questions about, you are encouraged to [contact](mailto:support@funkey-project.com) the FunKey Team directly. If you see information that you know is incorrect, you may leave a message on the [talk page](/wiki/User_talk:CoolieCoolster.md "User talk:CoolieCoolster") of the wiki admin, who will fix the error as soon as possible.

### What is the FunKey S?

From left to right: Atomic Purple, Original Purple, Retro Grey

The ** [FunKey S](/wiki/FunKey_S.md "FunKey S")** is a foldable portable [emulation device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console_emulator "w:Video game console emulator") that is designed to fit onto a keychain. Through emulators on its [FunKey-OS](/wiki/FunKey-OS.md "FunKey-OS") operating system, the FunKey S can emulate a wide variety of systems, including the Sega Genesis, PlayStation, and Game Boy Advance. Greatly resembling the larger [Game Boy Advance SP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance_SP "w:Game Boy Advance SP"), the FunKey S is currently sold in three colors: Original Purple, Retro Grey, and Atomic Purple. While the device includes a 32 gigabyte MicroSD card by default to store system firmware and any software the user wishes to install onto their device, this can be swapped out by the user with MicroSD cards up to the two terabyte limit of the MicroSDXC standard. To facilitate attaching the device to a keychain, the FunKey S has a metallic needle built into the bottom left corner of the device around which an included keychain lanyard is tied.

### What is included with the FunKey S?

The FunKey S product packaging

Included with the FunKey S is a 32 gigabyte MicroSD card to store the device's firmware and added software, a Micro-USB cable to charge and transfer files to the device, a keychain lanyard to attach the device to a keychain, a user manual, and four sets of extra buttons (red, blue, yellow, and green) that can be used by the user to customize their device.

### What buttons does the FunKey S have?

System buttons FN shortcuts

The system has thirteen buttons built into it: four directional buttons, four action buttons, two shoulder buttons, a START button, and two system buttons: _Menu_ and _Fn_. Centered at the top of the control panel, the Menu button serves two purposes: a short press activates the system menu, allowing the user to modify settings or return to the main menu, while a long press turns the system on or off. Sharing a button with SELECT, the Fn (Function) input extends the system's limited button count via the use of button combinations. In conjunction with the shoulder buttons, Fn activates the L2 and R2 trigger inputs of the PlayStation, while its use with the directional and action buttons grants access to the volume, brightness, zoom, aspect ratio, and screenshot shortcuts. While this functionality does [in rare cases](/wiki/List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues.md#Games-that-require-adapted-controls "List of games with compatibility issues") override button combinations used by games, each such case can be solved by the device's per-game or per-console button remapping capabilities. In addition to the white or grey buttons installed by default, packaged with the FunKey S are green, blue, red, and yellow button sets that the user may use to further personalize their device.

### Which systems can the FunKey S emulate?

The currently officially supported systems are the [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System "w:Nintendo Entertainment System"), [Master System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_System "w:Master System"), [TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurboGrafx-16 "w:TurboGrafx-16"), [Sega Genesis/Sega Mega Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Genesis "w:Sega Genesis") (along with its [Sega 32X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_32X "w:Sega 32X") and [Sega CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_CD "w:Sega CD") add-ons), [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy "w:Game Boy"), [Atari Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Lynx "w:Atari Lynx"), [Game Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Gear "w:Game Gear"), [SNES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System "w:Super Nintendo Entertainment System"), [PlayStation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console) "w:PlayStation (console)"), [Game Boy Color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color "w:Game Boy Color"), [Neo Geo Pocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_Geo_Pocket "w:Neo Geo Pocket"), [WonderSwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WonderSwan "w:WonderSwan"), and [Game Boy Advance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance "w:Game Boy Advance"). While the official NES and TurboGrafx-16 emulators have functional support for the Famicom Disk System and TurboGrafx-CD add-ons, respectively, when additional BIOS files are added, as this support is not yet officially implemented, some features, such as Famicom Disk System disk side swapping, are not supported.

While awaiting future firmware updates, [third-party emulators](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications.md#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications") can be used to emulate officially unsupported systems via the Gmenu2x launcher. Such systems currently include [Arcade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcade_game "w:Arcade game"), [Atari 2600](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600 "w:Atari 2600"), [ColecoVision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColecoVision "w:ColecoVision"), [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64 "w:Commodore 64"), [Neo Geo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_Geo_(system) "w:Neo Geo (system)"), [Pokémon Mini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Mini "w:Pokémon Mini"), [SG-1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG-1000 "w:SG-1000"), and [Virtual Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Boy "w:Virtual Boy"). While a native port of Super Mario 64 to the FunKey S was made possible by that game's decompilation, general Nintendo 64 emulation is currently not, and likely will not be, possible.

### What software is pre-installed onto the FunKey S?

The FunKey S runs [FunKey-OS](/wiki/FunKey-OS.md "FunKey-OS"), a purpose-made open source Linux distribution. Launchable from one of the device's two application launchers, the device's seven default emulators enable the emulation of twelve consoles out of the box, with Game Boy Advance and improved PlayStation emulation requiring the addition of [BIOS files](#why-does-the-funkey-s-need-emulated-system-bios-files) by the user. While the list of consoles emulated out of the box is expected to grow with future firmware updates, [third-party emulators](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications") can also be used to give the device additional emulation capabilities. While the device includes [61 homebrew games](#which-games-are-included-on-the-funkey-s) to help demonstrate its functionality, users may also add their own games and box art to the device's emulated system folders to expand their FunKey S game catalogue. Should the need arise, users can edit or delete any file on the device via _Commander_, the included file management application, without the need to connect the FunKey S to a computer. As FunKey-OS is open source, the files used to build it are publicly available on the FunKey Team's [GitHub page](https://github.com/FunKey-Project/FunKey-OS).

### Why are there no commercial games included with the FunKey S?

As the unlicensed distribution of copyrighted games in any circumstance is illegal piracy, the FunKey S only comes with freely-distributable homebrew games hand-picked for their quality. This means that users seeking to emulate copyrighted games on the device must extract their own game backups and transfer them to the device's console folders. Alternatively, many games originally released in a physical format are now available digitally on platforms such as Steam, with the ROMs of those games often extractable for personal use in external emulators such as those of the FunKey S. A list of such games is available on [this page](/wiki/List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial).md "List of emulatable games (commercial)") of the FunKey Wiki.

### Where can I find additional software for the FunKey S?

While users can put ROM backups of their own physical and digital commercial games onto the FunKey S, there is also much freeware and commercial software that can be legally acquired and used on the device. As the system's operating system is both well-documented and open source, third-party developers have released dozens of natively-running [original and ported programs](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications.md "List of third-party OPK applications") for the device that are not limited by the bottleneck of an emulator. In terms of emulatable software, however, the FunKey Wiki also maintains lists of hundreds of [freeware](/wiki/List_of_emulatable_games_(freeware).md "List of emulatable games (freeware)") and [commercial](/wiki/List_of_emulatable_games_(commercial).md "List of emulatable games (commercial)") games, as well as several dozen [utilities and public domain e-books](/wiki/List_of_emulatable_utilities.md "List of emulatable utilities").

### How many games can fit on the FunKey S?

As the game library file sizes of all the cartridge-based consoles emulated on the FunKey S add up to only 13.4 GB, a user could, in theory, have thousands of games on their FunKey S without needing to upgrade its 32 gigabyte MicroSD card (with 27.8 gigabytes of this being accessible with the factory configuration). Since CD-based games (PlayStation, Sega CD, TurboGrafx-CD) have significantly larger file sizes than cartridge-based games, only fifty to sixty CD-based games could fit on the FunKey S before a larger MicroSD card would be needed. While 27.8 gigabytes of available storage is more than enough to fit the game libraries of most users, any user with more than fifty CD-based games should check the total file size of their game library to see whether or not they require a larger MicroSD card. The chart below documents the average game file sizes for each of the thirteen consoles that the FunKey S officially emulates, with several file size totals corresponding to theoretical game libraries that have the same number of games from each system. As illustrated by the proportions listed below, the number of games a user can fit onto their FunKey S is directly related to number of CD-based games present in their game library. For instance, the average PlayStation game takes up the same amount of space as approximately 2,566 NES games, 2,277 Master System games, 1,395 TurboGrafx-16 games, 433 Sega Genesis games, 2,740 Game Boy games, 2,667 Atari Lynx games, 1,717 Game Gear games, 363 SNES games, 414 Game Boy Color games, 368 Neo Geo Pocket games, 313 WonderSwan games, or 78 Game Boy Advance games.

| System | Avg. ROM Size | Proportion | Number of Games Each |
| NES / Famicom | 220.85 KB | 0.04% | 15 (195 overall) | 30 (390 overall) | 45 (585 overall) |

### Is multiplayer possible on the FunKey S?

As neither link cables nor additional controllers can be connected to the FunKey S, multiplayer modes that require these features are not playable on the device. However, multiplayer modes that are implemented in a [hotseat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotseat_(multiplayer_mode) "w:Hotseat (multiplayer mode)") manner (one controller with one system) are playable on the FunKey S. While the majority of games that implement this mode do so using a "pass-and-play" method where players take turns (usually turn-based sports, strategy, and tabletop games), several instead have two players use the same controller simultaneously. Users interested in seeing which games emulatable on the FunKey S use hotseat multiplayer may view the wiki's [comprehensive list](/wiki/List_of_games_with_hotseat_multiplayer.md "List of games with hotseat multiplayer") of such games.

### Where can I find game box art?

Users searching for box art specifically for their FunKey S game collection can make use of the wiki's [database of resized game art](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k55I5ig_wISP5RGjnH6K63H4LV9s-g3U?usp=sharing), all of which having resolutions matching, at their respective aspect ratios, the 240x240 resolution of the FunKey S for maximal efficiency. As this database does not currently include box art for Master System, Atari Lynx, Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket, or WonderSwan games, Libretro's GitHub page of [thumbnail repositories](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails) should be used to acquire their box art instead. Should you wish to automatically download box art for your entire game collection at once, the [Skraper](http://skraper.net/) program can be used instead. Since the image representing a game on the FunKey S is the image in the file directory that shares a name with that game, users may use any JPG or PNG format images to represent games on the FunKey S.

### Where can I find Gmenu2x wallpapers?

To complement the set of default Gmenu2x wallpapers, the FunKey Wiki maintains a database of minimalist FunKey S wallpapers [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dYCPLxipiOZ3FPd67AGfUwI0EEA8UfAF?usp=sharing). Users may also use any 240-pixel square PNG format image as a Gmenu2x wallpaper on their FunKey S. Once acquired, Gmenu2x wallpapers should be put in the _/mnt/FunKey/.gmenu2x/skins/240x240/Default/Wallpapers_ location of the FunKey S file system. If you don't see the _.gmenu2x_ folder, your computer's Unix-based operating system is hiding hidden folders. To enable the viewing of such folders on MacOS, use the _Shift+Cmd+Period_ key combination. To do so on ChromeOS, click the three-dot icon at the top-right of the _Files_ application and select the _Show hidden folders_ option.

### Where can I find FunKey S device schematics and 3D files?

The FunKey Team has FunKey S schematics, STL files, and a project STEP file for the device's shell components available on [Grabcad](https://grabcad.com/library/funkey-s-1). Schematics for the device's electrical components are available on the FunKey Team's [GitHub page](https://github.com/FunKey-Project/FunKey-S-Hardware). The device is under the [open hardware license](https://www.oshwa.org/definition/) which gives anyone the right to study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design.

### How long does the FunKey S battery last?

On a sixty minute full charge, the FunKey S has a median battery life of two hours. Since the device's battery life is impacted by CPU usage and brightness and audio levels, there can be significant deviation from the median by roughly thirty minutes in either direction. In practice, this means that low-intensity emulation such as that of the Game Boy will result in above-average battery life, while high-intensity emulation such as that of the PlayStation will result in below-average battery life.

Whether in use or not, the device charges when connected via Micro-USB to a portable battery or outlet, which is indicated by a blue LED that subsequently remains on until charging finishes or is interrupted. The device's current charge level is indicated by the battery icon at the top right corner of the default RetroFE menu or at the bottom right of the alternate Gmenu2x menu, with a red low-charge icon appearing in the top right corner of the screen should the device run low on charge during gameplay. If the device runs out of charge, an autosave of the game currently being played is generated prior to shutdown and returned to when the system is recharged and reopened.

### Does the FunKey S support RTC (real-time clock) functionality?

The FunKey S supports the RTC functionalities used by Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance games, such as Harvest Moon GBC, Pokemon Crystal, and Pokemon Emerald. It does this by siphoning an extremely small amount of charge from the device's battery, allowing games that employ the feature to keep track of time. RTC functionality is still preserved even if the FunKey S is turned off or runs out of charge, as there is a buffer of charge reserved for such an instance. To best make use of the RTC feature, it is recommended that users rely solely on in-game saves for games with RTC functionality, as save states and autosaves can affect the RTC timing of games.

### Can FunKey S save game data be transferred?

While FunKey S autosave save files (_.quicksave_) are entirely incompatible with external emulators, FunKey S emulator save state files (_.000_, _.001_, etc.) other than those of the PlayStation are compatible with matching emulators on other platforms, such as the PC version of FCEUX in the case of NES games. Additionally, for games that support them, the transfer of in-game saves is an alternative option that is generally compatible with a wider range of emulators. Note, however, that a third-party emulator having an in-game save file format with a matching file extension does not guarantee that it will be listed below, as other factors, such as expected save file size, can impact in-game save file format compatibility between emulators. As battery-based in-game saving did not become commonplace until the 1990s, games for earlier systems emulated by the FunKey S, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System, TurboGrafx-16, and Sega Genesis, often do not support this type of saving, with many, such as all Atari Lynx games with an in-game save feature, using password-based saves instead. For several dozen NES and Genesis games, however, [SRAM ROM hacks](/wiki/List_of_recommended_ROM_hacks.md#saving "List of recommended ROM hacks") can be used to add in-game saving to games that did not originally have it, often replacing more tedious password-based saving systems. Due to an inaccuracy in the Master System emulation of the PicoDrive emulator, however, all in-game, battery-based saves of Master System games are incompatible with the FunKey S.

When a game does support battery-based in-game saving, however, an in-game save file is generated for it the first time it attempts to save data, with the extension of this file depending on the system the game is for. A table containing the corresponding in-game save file extension for each officially emulated system with in-game save file support, as well as the storage locations of these files and the third-party emulators compatible with them, is listed below. Transferring an in-game save file onto or off of the FunKey S is done by simply moving the file in question into or out of the folder in which in-game saves are stored for that game's system; usually the same folder as the game itself. Note that PlayStation _MCD_ files, placed in the _memcards_ folder within the PlayStation folder of the FunKey S, should be named _card#.mcd_, with the hashtag symbol replaced by the first number starting from one that isn't already used by an existing _MCD_ file.

In regards to SNES save files, if you don't see the _.snes96_snapshots_ folder in your computer's filesystem, its Unix-based operating system is hiding hidden folders. To enable the viewing of such folders on MacOS, use the _Shift+Cmd+Period_ key combination. To do so on ChromeOS, click the three-dot icon at the top-right of the _Files_ application and select the _Show hidden folders_ option. Note that as in-game save files generated by the Mednafen emulator include a string of characters between the game name and file extension, such save files must be renamed to remove the string of characters (ex. _.9d599a43d2c69738f3562f58aeff8828_) before they can be detected by emulators other than Mednafen. For the FunKey S, this applies to the TurboGrafx-16, Game Gear, Neo Geo Pocket, and WonderSwan systems. If you find that a third-party emulator compatible with any in-game saves generated by the [emulators of the FunKey S](#which-emulators-does-the-funkey-s-use) is not listed below, feel free to add it yourself or inform a wiki editor.

### Can ROM hacks be used on the FunKey S?

As ROM hacks are simply modified ROMs, in most cases they will work in the emulators of the FunKey S without issue. Cases in which ROM hacks may glitch or crash include several Game Boy Advance ROM hacks due to the [nine percent incompatibility rate](#are-there-any-games-that-arent-emulated-properly-on-the-funkey-s) of the default GBA emulator, as well as ROM hacks developed for use in specific emulators. A list of compatible ROM hacks recommended by the editors of the FunKey Wiki is available [here](/wiki/List_of_recommended_ROM_hacks.md "List of recommended ROM hacks").

### Can the FunKey S be used as an external storage device?

While the primary purpose of the FunKey S is the ability to use emulated and [natively-running](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications.md "List of third-party OPK applications") games and applications, it can also be used as an external storage device. While the slow transfer speed of its Micro-USB port and four gigabyte file size limit of its FAT32 file system make it less ideal for general file storage than most USB keys, SD cards, and external hard drives, the FunKey S having an operating system gives it the additional ability to interact with its stored files. While such capabilities come primarily from the included _Commander_ file management application, which can be used to view image files, view and edit text files, and move, rename, or delete any stored file, additional applications can be installed to give the device additional capabilities, such as video playback and Linux terminal access. As an external storage device, the FunKey S is also able to stream media files at qualities higher than it can stream itself to televisions, radios, and other media players with such functionality. Users wishing to transfer files to the FunKey S faster than the device's Micro-USB port is capable of can alternatively open their device, remove the MicroSD card, and transfer files to the card directly.

### Can cheats be used on the FunKey S?

While the FunKey S does not have officially implemented cheat support, with sufficient emulator and/or game configuration, several systems can have cheat support implemented by the user.

As the default NES emulator, FCEUX, is able to make use of the Game Genie's cheat code system, it is the simplest way to use cheats in NES games on the FunKey S. To enable the functionality, begin by renaming an NES Game Genie ROM file to _gg.rom_ and placing it in the _/mnt/FunKey/.fceux_ location of the FunKey S file system. If you don't see the _.fceux_ folder, your computer's Unix-based operating system is hiding hidden folders. To enable the viewing of such folders on MacOS, use the _Shift+Cmd+Period_ key combination. To do so on ChromeOS, click the three-dot icon at the top-right of the _Files_ application and select the _Show hidden folders_ option. Next, open the _fceux.cfg_ file also located in that folder in a text editor and replace the thirteenth line, <u>SDL.GameGenie = 0</u>, with <u>SDL.GameGenie = 1</u>. The next time an NES game is launched with the _New Game_ option via the default NES emulator, the Game Genie password menu will appear, allowing up to three Game Genie codes to be entered for the game in question. As Game Genie codes are entered before a game begins, keep in mind that FunKey S autosaves cannot be loaded while the setting is enabled. Therefore, to use Game Genie codes with pre-existing save data, ensure ahead of time that your game(s) are saved via in-game saves or emulator save states. To disable the Game Genie setting and re-enable the device's autosave feature for NES games, simply undo the modification made to the _fceux.cfg_ file.

To enable cheats in Game Boy Advance games, Game Shark codes must be patched into each game ahead of time, and are enabled by the user each time the game is started using the _New Game_ option. Begin by downloading, extracting, and launching the _GBAATM – Rebirth_ application for [Windows](/wiki/files/Xploder  format  Master Codes , either use the one made by the same people who made the cheat codes that you're using or test several until you find one that works. Codes should be added two lines at a time, with a code's name entered on the first line and its alphanumerical string entered on the second. Note that a game's  Master Code , if present, should always be the first code listed, with the name  Master  entered on the first line and all segments of the comparatively long alphanumerical string combined on the second line. Once all desired codes are entered, press the  Patch Game!  button below the text box to patch the codes into the selected game. Should the patching process be successful, a message indicating so will appear in the application's second text box and the patched game will appear in the chosen file location. Lastly, add the modified ROM to the  GBA  folder of the FunKey S as per usual. When starting the game with the  New Game  option, a cheat code menu will appear in-game to allow you to choose which of the added codes you wish to use with the game. After you've finished selecting codes with the A button, press START to launch the game.

### Can the FunKey S inputs be remapped?

Via the use of _KEY_ files, the inputs of all systems and games emulated by the FunKey S can be remapped by the user. This includes system shortcut inputs, some of which users may wish to relocate or disable should they not be commonly used or interfere with gameplay. When a _KEY_ file is used, it modifies the inputs set by the system's default input mapping file, available for download [here](/wiki/files/Fkgpiod.zip). This file defines via the use of the  MAP  function which shortcut (such as  brightness up ) or input (such as  KEY R ) is associated with which button (such as  START ) or button combination (such as  FN+UP ). As all inputs are already predefined by this file, only inputs being modified should be included in  KEY  files.

In addition to its regular input mapping functionality, the _MAP_ function is also used to overwrite previous mappings with new ones. To do this, following the word _MAP_ the button or button combination and input or shortcut be remapped should be defined, seperated by the function _TO KEY_ if remapping inputs or zoom or aspect ratio shortcuts, or _TO COMMAND_ if remapping any other shortcut. Should the user wish to create a _KEY_ file that switches the A and B inputs, for instance, all that would be needed would be _MAP A TO KEY KEY_B_ on the first line and _MAP B TO KEY KEY_A_ on the second. Note the formatting of the inputs; KEY_A and KEY_B. All inputs, as well as the zoom in, zoom out, and aspect ratio shortcuts, are defined in _KEY_ files by _KEY__ followed by a letter. Should remapping occur without the input of the secondary button swapped to the first button (whether due to that input being moved to an empty slot such as FN+START or simply overwritten and not replaced), the _UNMAP_ function should first be used to remove the original mapping so that the input is not mapped to two buttons simultaneously. For instance, should a user wish to remove the aspect ratio shortcut and move the snapshot shortcut to its place, the _KEY_ file for doing so would simply have _UNMAP FN+UP_ on the first line and _MAP FN+DOWN TO COMMAND snapshot_ on the second. In creating _KEY_ files, note that due to a glitch with the formatting of such files, games with apostrophes in their title currently must be renamed to have _KEY_ file support (such as renaming _Kirby's Dream Land.gb_ to _Kirbys Dream Land.gb_). For additional _KEY_ file examples, consult the FunKey Wiki's list of [pre-configured KEY files](/wiki/List_of_pre-configured_KEY_files.md "List of pre-configured KEY files").

To supplement the above-listed default input mapping file, a table detailing the associations between emulated system inputs and system inputs, as well as the default mapping of those inputs to the device's buttons, is listed below. Note that while the lack of X, Y, and Z mapping capabilities for the Sega Genesis and Mega Drive does not result in any game incompatibilities, the lack of Y1, Y2, Y3, and Y4 mapping capabilities for the WonderSwan and WonderSwan Color means that vertical games for that system are currently [incompatible with the FunKey S](/wiki/List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues#Games_that_require_improved_emulation "List of games with compatibility issues"). Following that table is another table that lists the same information for the device's shortcuts.

### Why does the FunKey S need emulated system BIOS files?

Emulators function using either low-level emulation (LLE) or high-level emulation (HLE), with the former directly emulating the processes of the original system and the latter merely simulating them. While both methods are commonly used and have distinct benefits, the truer 'emulation' of LLE means emulators that use this method require the system ROM of the original hardware to function. This ROM, known as the BIOS, performs system-critical tasks for many systems, with neither the original hardware nor an LLE emulator of that hardware being functional without the associated BIOS file. In the case of the FunKey S, while the majority of its emulated systems do not require BIOS files, there are two that do: the PlayStation and Game Boy Advance. While some PlayStation games can be emulated without a BIOS file and alternate, albeit slower, Game Boy Advance emulators that don't require BIOS files are [available](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications"), to properly emulate either system using the default emulators a BIOS file for each is required. As with video game ROMs, BIOS files are protected by copyright restrictions and thus also cannot be legally distributed with the FunKey S. Users may extract BIOS files from PlayStation and Game Boy Advance units that they own and add them to the FunKey S emulators for those systems to improve functionality for the former and enable functionality for the latter. Additionally, while Sega Genesis and TurboGrafx-16 games do not require the presence of BIOS files to be accurately emulated, games for their respective add-ons, the Sega CD and TurboGrafx-CD, do. A tutorial for adding emulator BIOS files to the FunKey S can be found [here](https://doc.funkey-project.com/user_manual/tutorials/software/gba_bios/).

### Why doesn't the FunKey S have more than 64 megabytes of RAM?

The FunKey S has 64 megabytes of RAM due to that being the amount built into its [system on a chip (SoC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip "w:System on a chip"), the Allwinner V3s. While several handheld emulation systems with similar capabilities to the FunKey S include several times more RAM than it, the lightweight Linux distribution used by the FunKey S, in addition to its carefully chosen and optimized collection of emulators, allows it to emulate games at relatively high levels of accuracy while using comparatively little RAM. The inclusion of additional RAM in the FunKey S would not result in improved performance or additional emulation capabilities.

### Why doesn't the FunKey S have a 60 FPS refresh rate?

The FunKey S display refreshes at a maximum rate of 50 FPS due to that being the most data the device's processor can send to the display's internal graphics memory each second. If this were not a limitation, the display would otherwise have a maximum refresh rate of 120 FPS. As NTSC games are still emulated at 60 FPS, however, ten frames are dropped each second rather than gameplay being slowed down to match the differing frame rate. As this issue was anticipated during the designing of the FunKey S, however, several software and hardware techniques were implemented to avoid screen tearing between the remaining 50 frames of NTSC games.

### Why doesn't the FunKey S have USB-C and auxiliary (headphone jack) ports?

The small form factor of the FunKey S made the use of Micro-USB instead of USB-C necessary and left no room for an auxiliary port for use with headphones or external speakers. While the Micro-USB standard supports the output of video and audio data signals by a host device, the limited space inside the device also made adding this functionality to the FunKey S not possible. Despite this, the FunKey Wiki lists such [hardware suggestions](/wiki/FunKey_Wiki_Suggestion_Center#Hardware_modification_suggestions_for_future_devices "FunKey Wiki Suggestion Center") at the wiki's [Suggestion Center](/wiki/FunKey_Wiki_Suggestion_Center.md "FunKey Wiki Suggestion Center"), as there is a chance that they could be implemented in future FunKey Team devices.

### Are there any games that aren't emulated properly on the FunKey S?

While the average emulation quality of its default emulators is relatively high, the FunKey S cannot emulate several games out of the box for a variety of reasons. These include incompatible controls, unemulated specialty hardware, and emulation imperfections, among others. A list of all the games known to be incompatible with the device's default emulators is located [here](/wiki/List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues#Incompatible_games "List of games with compatibility issues"). Many of these games, however, can still be played via one of the several [third-party emulators](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications#Emulators "List of third-party OPK applications") available for the device. This includes multi-disk PlayStation games, which while not fully-playable in the default version of PCSX-ReARMed, are fully-playable in the third-party version that has disk-swapping functionality enabled. As an illustration of the device's capabilities, a table of estimated compatibility rates for each officially emulated system has been compiled below. For the purposes of these counts, a game is counted as incompatible if it cannot be played to completion using solely the FunKey S. As wiki contributors have conducted extensive research and game testing to find incompatible games, all compatibility rates listed here are believed to be accurate or very near accurate. In cases where all of a system's incompatibilities are due to unemulated hardware, that system's compatibility rate is italicized. While the emulation of Famicom Disk System and TurboGrafx-CD games on the FunKey S is functional via the addition of their respective BIOS files, as this functionality has not yet been fully-implemented into FunKey-OS, the compatibility rates of those console add-ons are excluded from the table below. As homebrew games can have varying compatibility with the systems they are developed for, their compatibility is also not reflected in the table below. Note that due to its extensive game library, the PlayStation's _Licensed Games_ figure is simply an estimate calculated by the wiki editors, though should be accurate to within roughly one hundred games in either direction.

| System | Licensed Games | Known Incompatibilities | Estimated Compatibility Rate |
| NES / Famicom | 1421 | 9 | _99.37%_ |
| Sega Master System | 360 | 14 | 96.11% |
| TurboGrafx-16 / PC Engine | 413 | 0 | 100% |
| Genesis / Mega Drive / CD / 32X | 1123 | 0 | 100% |

| Game Gear | 364 | 18 | 95.05% |
| SNES / Super Famicom | 1757 | 31 | 98.24% |
| PlayStation | _4750_ | 102 | 97.85% |
| Game Boy Color | 915 | 10 | 98.91% |
| Neo Geo Pocket / Neo Geo Pocket Color | 92 | 0 | 100% |
| WonderSwan / WonderSwan Color | 199 | 5 | 97.49% |
| Game Boy Advance | 1536 | 139 | 90.95% |
| <u>Total</u> | **14052** | **334** | **97.62%** |

### Which emulators does the FunKey S use?

Listed in the table below are the emulators included by default with the FunKey S, with the systems they emulate and their accepted ROM file extensions listed on the right. Other than Game Boy, Game Boy Color, TurboGrafx-CD, Sega CD, and PlayStation games, all of the file formats are also detected if stored in _ZIP_ archives. For a list of the in-game save file formats generated for each of the emulated systems, consult the [save data section](#can-funkey-s-save-game-data-be-transferred) above.

### How do I combine a PlayStation game's multiple BIN files into a single BIN file?

As all of a PlayStation game's BIN files are listed in the FunKey S game list, to minimize the time is takes to scroll through one's game library, each game should only have one BIN file. If your PlayStation game has multiple BIN files across multiple disks, follow [these instructions](#how-do-i-combine-files-from-multiple-playstation-disks-into-a-single-rom-file). If these BIN files are all for one disk, to merge them you will first need to download [IsoBuster](https://www.isobuster.com/download.php). Once this is done, open the program and select _Open Image File_, indicated by an icon of a folder containing a blue downwards arrow. Navigating to and selecting the CUE file of the game in question will make a CD icon appear in the IsoBuster interface, which you then right click, selecting the _Raw .bin_ option under the _Extract CD <Image>_ category. After you save the BIN and CUE files, place these new files into the PS1 folder of the FunKey S.

### How do I combine files from multiple PlayStation disks into a single ROM file?

If the files from multiple disks of a PlayStation game are added to the FunKey S, they will all appear in the game list, complicating game library navigation and disk transferring. To merge all of these files into a single _PBP_ file, you will need both the [PSX2PSP](https://www.psx-place.com/resources/psx2psp.586/) application and the copyrighted _BASE.PBP_ file, which must be added to the _Files_ folder of that application. Once this is done, open the application with the _Clasic mode_ shortcut and select the _Options_ button at the bottom left. This will open a page with various application settings, of which you should change the _Compression level_ to _1 (worst)_ and the _toc_ setting to _CUE File_. Once this is done, save the setting modifications to return to the main program interface. From here, press the three dot icon next to _ISO/PBP File 1 - No file selected_ at the top left and select the BIN file of the first disk. Repeat this process for each subsequent disk by selecting the arrow icon to the left of the aforementioned three dot icon, selecting each disk number in turn. Once this process is complete, select the folder on your system where you wish the PBP file to be saved to and press the _Convert_ button at the bottom of the program window. Once the conversion process is finished, navigate to the completed EBOOT.PBP file, rename it, and place it into the PS1 folder of the FunKey S.

### Is the FunKey S legal?

As it is the improper acquisition of ROMs, and not emulation itself, that is illegal to varying degrees around the world, the FunKey S remains entirely legal. While the device does come bundled with several dozen freeware games to give it basic out-of-box functionality, it includes neither commercial games nor the copyrighted PlayStation and Game Boy Advance BIOS files. While some users may choose to put illegally-acquired ROMs on their devices, both the FunKey Team and the editors of this wiki encourage users to look through the FunKey Wiki's lists of hundreds of [legally-acquirable](/wiki/Available_third-party_software.md "Available third-party software") game ROMs, both freeware and commercial.

### Where can I buy a FunKey S?

The FunKey S is currently available for pre-order on the [FunKey Project store page](https://funkey-project.myshopify.com/products/funkey-s). While the device itself costs €65 (~US$77), additional shipping and taxation costs will make the total cost higher. The amount these additional costs add up to depends on an order's country of destination, with shipping fees for most users being between €7 (~US$8.25) and €10 (~US$11.75) and value-added tax rates ranging from €12.41 to €19.71 per device only charged to European Union customers. For French and non-EU customers, an order's per-unit shipping fee can be lowered by buying multiple devices at once, with the lowest per-unit fee applied to orders containing five or more devices. A comprehensive list of shipping fees for each country the FunKey S ships to can be found [here](/wiki/List_of_countries_by_FunKey_S_availability#Available "List of countries by FunKey S availability").

### Where can I get accessories for the FunKey S?

Although the FunKey Team is not currently selling any accessories for the FunKey S aside from what is included with it, the editors of this wiki have compiled [a list of products](/wiki/List_of_FunKey_S_compatible_keychain_accessories.md "List of FunKey S compatible keychain accessories") that can be used in conjunction with the FunKey S, including adapters, power banks, cables, pouches, and keychain decorations. To match the FunKey S keychain aesthetic, research has been conducted to ensure that all listed accessories do not exceed size or weight levels that would make putting them on a keychain inconvenient. While the editors of this wiki have conducted extensive research to confirm that all products listed are compatible and legitimate, neither the editors nor the FunKey Team are responsible for the reliability of third-party products. Therefore, prior to making any purchase, users should verify that a listed product adequately meets their needs.

### Can I develop software for the FunKey S?

As both the hardware specifications and operating system of the FunKey S are open source and documented on the FunKey Team's [GitHub page](https://github.com/FunKey-Project), users are able and encouraged to develop their own software for the device. To facilitate this, an SDK has been created and made [available](https://github.com/FunKey-Project/FunKey-OS/releases/tag/FunKey-OS-2.0.0) for [FunKey-OS](/wiki/FunKey-OS.md "FunKey-OS") software development. Additionally, a [development guide](https://doc.funkey-project.com/developers/hardware_ref/design/) is available on the documentation page of the FunKey website. The FunKey Wiki maintains a [database](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications.md "List of third-party OPK applications") of all third-party software developed for the FunKey S, so developers who wish to create an article for their program or add it to one of the lists can either edit the wiki themselves or ask a wiki editor to do so for them.

### Who is the FunKey Team?

Based in the city of Bordeaux in southwestern France, the FunKey Team is comprised of four people: Vincent, Michel, David, and Killian. Founded by Vincent and Michel in 2017 as a joint effort to create the group's first system, the [Keymu](/wiki/Keymu.md "Keymu"), the FunKey Team subsequently expanded to include David and Killian to develop and commercially release the [FunKey S](/wiki/FunKey_S.md "FunKey S") as an improved version of the Keymu.

### How can I contact the FunKey Team?

While the FunKey Team's numerous social media pages are represented with the icons at the top of this page, they can be contacted directly via the [contact page](https://www.funkey-project.com/contact) of their website. If you wish to email them, questions regarding the FunKey S can be sent to their [support](mailto:support@funkey-project.com) email address, while other inquiries can be sent to their [contact](mailto:contact@funkey-project.com) email address.

### Where is the FunKey S manufactured?

FunKey S production is contracted out by the FunKey Team to a manufacturing facility in Shenzhen, China. After all components arrive and are assembled at that facility, the devices are shipped directly by a nearby shipping firm to international customers.
