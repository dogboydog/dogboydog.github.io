The **FunKey Community Discord Server** is a community-operated discussion forum for the [FunKey S](/wiki/FunKey_S "FunKey S") that was founded following the launch of the device's Kickstarter campaign in July 2020. While the [members of the FunKey Team](/wiki/FunKey_Wiki_Knowledge_Center#Who_is_the_FunKey_Team? "FunKey Wiki Knowledge Center") are also on the server, their presence is first and foremost to answer questions posed by the community, as they are involved in neither the management nor moderation of the server. While the server does maintain and enforce rules in the interests of preventing the distribution of pirated content and fostering a safe and open community, users are free to discuss any thoughts they have about the FunKey S, whether positive or negative. Now counting over 2,500 members, the server has facilitated third-party FunKey S project collaboration, leading to the creation of additional [launcher themes](/wiki/List_of_third-party_launcher_themes "List of third-party launcher themes") and [applications](/wiki/List_of_third-party_OPK_applications "List of third-party OPK applications"). As a means of encouraging further community participation and discussion, events such as [community polls](/wiki/FunKey_Community_Poll "FunKey Community Poll") and [community speedruns](/wiki/FunKey_Speedrun_Leaderboards "FunKey Speedrun Leaderboards") are held. Questions regarding the FunKey Community Discord Server may be asked on the [server itself](https://discord.gg/G9kCvjg) or on the [talk page](/wiki/Talk:FunKey_Community_Discord_Server "Talk:FunKey Community Discord Server") of this article.

Following the one year anniversary of the server in July 2021, sticker sets were printed to serve as a reward for community participation. Mimicking the NES, Mega Drive, SNES, PlayStation, Dreamcast, and GameCube consoles, as well as the Classic NES, Pikachu Yellow, and Triforce Gold variants of the GBA SP and the white variant of the Nintendo DS Lite, the stickers are designed to fit onto the top of the FunKey S as a means of customization. The following lists detail the past, current, and future community events that involved the distribution of stickers as a reward:

#### Past

* <u>Sticker designer rewards:</u> Sticker sets were offered to each member who designed one or more of the six stickers printed out for the first sticker project.
* <u>Community dedication awards:</u> Sticker sets were offered as awards to two community members for their dedication in providing FunKey S owners with additional functionality for their devices.
* <u>Sticker designer rewards:</u> Sticker sets were offered to each member who designed one or more of the four stickers printed out for the second sticker project.
* <u>2000 Member Milestone Raffle:</u> To celebrate the FunKey Community Discord Server having reached 2000 members, a raffle was held to give away four sticker sets at random to participating members.
* <u>Community dedication awards:</u> Sticker sets were offered as awards to two community members for their dedication in providing FunKey S owners with additional functionality for their devices.

#### Current

* <u>Wiki support rewards:</u> A total of twenty sticker sets will be distributed to users who donate at least $30 to the host of the FunKey Wiki, Miraheze. For donation confirmation, it is suggested that users let the Community Discord Server Manager _Coolie_ know about their donation ahead of time, and when they do [donate](https://meta.miraheze.org/wiki/Donate) to Miraheze using the recommended option, PayPal, that they include a comment asking for donation attribution to _[Username] (FunKey Wiki)_.

#### Future

* <u>RetroFE theme competition:</u> Once there are enough designers on the FunKey Community Discord Server, a theme design competition will be held.

Additional sticker distribution events will be listed here after they are planned and announced on the FunKey Community Discord Server.
