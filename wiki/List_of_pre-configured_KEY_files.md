# List of pre-configured KEY files

From The FunKey Wiki



This article lists pre-configured _KEY_ files available for download on The FunKey Wiki. As the purpose of these files is to modify the default mapping of inputs to the buttons of the FunKey S, they are generally used to enable access to button combinations blocked by the FN shortcuts of the FunKey S. To install any of the _KEY_ files listed in this article, begin by downloading and extracting its respective file. After ensuring that the _KEY_ and ROM file names match, place the _KEY_ file in the same folder as that game on the FunKey S. In reading the tables present in this article, note that the →, ↔, and ⇋ symbols are used to indicate when button inputs are moved, swapped, and duplicated, respectively.

### General

_KEY_ files listed in this section were created for general use cases, rather than any game in particular. Listed for each are the mapping modifications made, the systems it can be used on, and a general description of the purpose of the remapping. As these _KEY_ files aren't named for use with any game in particular, they must be renamed to match the name of the games they are being used with to become functional.

| Modifications | Recommended system(s) | Description | KEY File |
| FN functionality → START | Any | Remaps all FN functionality from SELECT to START as an alternative, simpler remapping for games with button combinations that include SELECT. | [Download](/wiki/files/FN-Switch_Key_File.zip) |
| SELECT (input) → FN+START | Moves the SELECT component of FN to the unused FN+START mapping location to avoid its accidental use while using shortcuts and make it possible to use it with other shortcuts. | [Download](/wiki/files/Dedicated-FN-START-SELECT_Key_File.zip) |
| SELECT → START START (input) → FN+START | Moves SELECT to START and START to the unused FN+START mapping location to avoid the accidental use of SELECT while using shortcuts. The counterpart to _SELECT → FN+START_ in cases where SELECT is used more often than START. | [Download](/wiki/files/Dedicated-FN-SELECT-START_Key_File.zip) |
| SELECT (input) ⇋ FN+START | Duplicates the SELECT component of FN to the unused FN+START mapping location to avoid its accidental use while using shortcuts and make it possible to use it with other shortcuts. An alternative to _SELECT (input) → FN+START_ for situations where quick access to SELECT is still helpful. | [Download](/wiki/files/Duplicate-SELECT_Key_File.zip) |
|  ​ ​ ​FN ⇋ L START ⇋ R ​ ​ ​ | Master System TurboGrafx-16 Sega Genesis Atari Lynx Game Gear WonderSwan | Adds duplicate mappings of FN/SELECT and START to the shoulder buttons for systems where the shoulder buttons are not used. | [Download](/wiki/files/SELECT-START-Duplicate_Key_File.zip) |
| NES Game Boy Game Boy Color Neo Geo Pocket |
|  ​No X input No Y input ​ | Removes the duplicate mappings of A and B to Y and X for the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Neo Geo Pocket, and Game Boy Advance. | [Download](/wiki/files/No-X-Or-Y-Inputs_Key_File.zip) |
| Game Boy Advance |
| L → Y R → X | Remaps the shoulder button inputs to the X and Y inputs as an easier to access button mapping layout for Game Boy Advance games. | [Download](/wiki/files/LR-to-YX_Key_File.zip) |
| L/R ↔ L2/R2 | PlayStation | Swaps the mappings of the shoulder buttons with those of the trigger buttons for games that make use of the trigger buttons more often than the shoulder buttons. | [Download](/wiki/files/Shoulder-Trigger-Swap_Key_File.zip) |

### Game-specific

_KEY_ files listed in this section were created to enable access to one or more button combinations in a game made inaccessible by the FN functionality of the FunKey S. While the extent to which these files remap controls ranges from simple control swaps to controller reconfigurations, all of them are believed to allow access to the listed button combinations while still allowing for regular gameplay.

#### Required

Also listed on the wiki's [game compatibility list](/wiki/List_of_games_with_compatibility_issues#Games_that_require_adapted_controls "List of games with compatibility issues"), the following games have button combinations required for core gameplay that cannot be used by default due to interfering shortcuts. While most retain access to all shortcuts via shortcut or button relocation, due to their higher than average number of button combinations, _Treasures of the Deep_, _Wing Commander_, and _Wing Commander: The Secret Missions_ required the removal of several system shortcuts to ensure game compatibility. When feasible, multiple _KEY_ files are listed to allow users to choose their preferred remapping. As _Final Fantasy VIII_ only requires its L2+R2 button combination once for the _X-ATM092_ boss fight, an [alternate key file](/wiki/files/Final_Fantasy_VIII_Alternate_KEY_File.zip) that returns the mapping of the shoulder and trigger inputs to normal can subsequently be used.

#### Optional features

The following games have optional gameplay features that require the use of button combinations that include SELECT, L2, or R2. As the in-game time setting of _Pokémon Gold and Silver_ can only be adjusted once via the official method, should you be playing _Pokémon Gold_, the use of that game's [RTC Changer ROM hack](/wiki/List_of_recommended_ROM_hacks#Improvement_hacks "List of recommended ROM hacks") is recommended instead. As the Game Boy and Game Boy Color games below are all emulated by the _gnuboy_ emulator, their controls can be alternatively remapped via the use of that emulator's configuration file. A pre-configured version of that file that adds additional mappings of FN and START to the device's shoulder buttons can be downloaded [here](/wiki/files/.gnuboy_ location of the FunKey S file system. If you don't see the _.gnuboy_ folder, your computer's Unix-based operating system is hiding hidden folders. To enable the viewing of such folders on MacOS, use the _Shift+Cmd+Period_ key combination. To do so on ChromeOS, click the three-dot icon at the top-right of the _Files_ application and select the _Show hidden folders_ option.

#### Cheat codes

The following PlayStation games are known to have cheat codes that require the use of one or more button combinations for activation. Due to _Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo_ and _Syphon Filter_ having several complex button combinations that together use nearly all the device's inputs, their button combinations have been grouped into categories with differing _KEY_ files to make the most of the available inputs. While regular gameplay of _Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation_ is still believed to be possible despite the extensive control scheme modifications made by its _KEY_ file, for a better gameplay experience when cheat code entry is not needed, the return to regular controls is recommended.
